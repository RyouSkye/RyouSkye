Hi, I'm Ryou Skye. This is my personal account, so whenever I actually manage to publish anything it'll mostly be me screwing around with stuff.

I don't know much yet but I'll do my best.

Wait for me not updating this for five years and then nothing applying anymore. Hi future me you do this all the time

edit: this is future me. past me was right. I'm a jr/unlabled PHP dev and have been working in that job for two years and rarely do side projects
